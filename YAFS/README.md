NEWS
====
A new version of YAFS is available in the [branch](https://github.com/acsicuib/YAFS/tree/YAFS3).
- It supports Python 3.6+. 
- It depends on fewer third-party libraries. It is lighter and easier to install.
- It has 4 new awesome "tutorial_scenarios" or skeletons so you can use them to create your scenario with artificial intelligence, rules, neural networks, ... with whatever you want.
- Notes:
  - Most of the previous examples in folder "examples" are now up to date for this version, but the code for the examples which are not updated are still kept for you to inspire.
  - Some parts of the Doc is still not updated. 

DESCRIPTION
===========

YAFS (Yet Another Fog Simulator) is a simulator tool based on Python of architectures such as: [Fog Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog_computing) ecosystems for several analysis regarding with the placement of resources, cost deployment, network design, ... [IoT environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) are the most evident fact of this type of architecture.


The **highlights** points of YAFS are:
* **Dynamic topology:** entities and network links can be created or removed along the simulation.
* **Dynamic creation of messages sources:** sensors can generate messages from different point access along the simulation.
* And for hence, the **placement allocation algorithm** and **the orchestration algorithm,** that are extended by the user, can run along the simulation.
* The **topology of the network** is based on [Complex Network theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_network). Thus, the algorithms can obtain more valuable indicators from topological features.
* The **results** are stored in a raw format in a nosql database. The simpler the format, the easier it is to perform any type of statistics.

Resources
---------

YAFS tutorial (https://yafs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/index.html)
and user guide (https://www.slideshare.net/wisaaco/yet-another-fog-simulator-yafs-user-guide) are a good starting
point for you. You can also try out some of the Examples (https://yafs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/index.html) shipped with
YAFS but in any case you have to understand the main concepts of Cloud Computing and other related architectures to design and modelling your own model.


Installation (updated)
----------------------

YAFS3 (New Branch) requires Python 3.6+ ~~

1. Clone the project in your local folder:

```bash
    $ git clone --branch YAFS3 https://github.com/acsicuib/YAFS
```

2. Create one python virtual environment and install dependencies

```bash
   (venv)$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. I recommend you IDE such as Pycharm (educational licence) to configure Python paths.

Getting started & your first execution
--------------------------------------


To run some folder project you can create a simple bash script, with the following lines (please update the path according with your system) or you can use a python editor such as: Pycharm, Spyder, etc.
Personally, I recommend you Pycharm since it integrates all the paths.

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/<your path>/YAFS/src/:src/examples/Tutorial/
python src/examples/Tutorial/main1.py
```

The [YAFS tutorial](https://yafs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/index.html) is a good starting
point for you. You can also try out some of the [Examples](https://yafs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/index.html) shipped with
YAFS but in any case you have to understand the main concepts of Cloud Computing and other related architectures to design and modelling your own model.


Graph animations
----------------
As you can implement events (custom strategies), you can generate plots of your network in each event. Thus, you can store png files and at the end of your simulation, you generate a video with the combination all of them using *ffmpeg* command.

You can find some examples in the following *src/examples*: DynamicWorkloads, ConquestService, and mobileTutorial. From *DynamicWorkload* folder and *ConquestService*, we have generate the following animations:

```
ffmpeg -r 1 -i net_%03d.png -c:v libx264 -vf fps=1 -pix_fmt yuv420p out.mp4
ffmpeg -i out.mp4 -pix_fmt rgb24  out.gif

```

Documentation and Help
----------------------

The [documentation](https://yafs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) contains a [tutorial](https://yafs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/index.html), the [architecture design](https://yafs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architecture/index.html) explaining key
concepts, a number of [examples](https://yafs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/index.html) and the [API reference](https://yafs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/index.html).


For more help, contact with the authors or You must dig through the [source code](https://github.com/acsicuib/YAFS)

Improvements
------------
- sep. / 12 / 2019 Fixing bugs - All projects work with the attributes defined in the graph var (topology class) using NX library to manage the attributes.
- may / 23 / 2019 New improvements are included. Highlight that workloads/users and mobile endpoints can be represented through *gpx traces*. Geopositional libraries are required
- june / 25 / 2018 Bug Fixed - The DES.src metric of the CSV results is fixed. Identifies the DES-process who sends the message
- june / 20 / 2018 Messages from sources have an unique identifier that is copied in all the transmissions. We can trace each application invocation.
